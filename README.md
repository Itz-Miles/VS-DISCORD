# Building From Source

## Haxe

## Visual Studio / Visual Studio Code

Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

`windows` For compiling the game on windows, install [Visual Studio 19](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/older-downloads/#visual-studio-2019-and-other-products) and ONLY these components:
```
MSVC v142 - VS 2019 C++ x64/x86 build tools
Windows SDK (10.0.17763.0)

## Command Prompt/Terminal

 These methods send you to a terminal, which will be used to install libraries and compile the game.
